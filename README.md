# Cognate Detection Repository

## Details

This repository contains the data for two publications:

1. Challenge Dataset of Cognates and False Friend Pairs from Indian Languages (LREC 2020)

2. Harnessing Cross-lingual Features to Improve Cognate Detection for Low-resource Languages (COLING 2020)


## Dataset
We release the dataset described in our LREC submission with this repository. Please find the datasets D1, D2, and D3 as described in the paper here in their respective folders.

From here, D1 and D2 can be combined to replicate our COLING 2020 experiments on Cognate Detection for Indian Languages. The ILCI Parallel corpus used for Machine Translation-based experiments described in the paper is not distributable and licenced by TDIL, Indian Government. 
Kindly request the parallel corpus data from TDIL to replicated these experiments.

D3 is only concerning the LREC 2020 paper as it is the data which contains False Friends for Indian Languages
